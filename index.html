            <p>Hi! I'm Dana & I love tough problems. Let me join in on the fun on your next project. I'm more than a fullstack developer; I've been into problem-solving since I first learned how to play chess. I just did a bootcamp with Thinkful, so I'm equiped with the main tools of the web and itching to put them to good use.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding I'm out there getting inspired: whether it's with art, the great outdoors or just riding my bike down the trail. I like good music and learning about other people's culture when I'm relaxing to get myself in the mind of other's. The web was built for more than one person so knowing others really helps me make interfaces a better place.</p>
